 A backend Web Api for managing Movie Genres

As a first-time endeavor in Node and Express, I've created a RESTFUL API for movie management on either a movie website or in an actual store. During this project, I gained insight into several key areas:

Setting up Node.js and NPM, and the installation of various npm packages.
The fundamentals of Express and node, including functions, callbacks, and Promises, as well as incorporating "await" into my work.
CRUD operations for both users/customers and movies
Leveraging Jsonwebtoken for authentication and authorization
Along with some additional topics üëå
While still a novice, I recognize that my future projects will explore these concepts more in-depth üòÅ

Ps. Some of the things here might look a little outdated because of the tutorial I used.
